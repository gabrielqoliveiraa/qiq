## How to run this project
I'm still developing this project, but it isn't available to run such as CLI yet. So, you need to run using the project itself.

- npm install - to install all project's dependencies 
- npx ts-node src/index [COMMAND]

Examples:
- npx ts-node src/index add . 
- npx ts-node src/index init 
- npx ts-node src/index add src/index.ts
